## Description


This software utilizes Spatialite extended SQLite as a data store, .NET Core 6 as an application layer, and React as a front-end. This software demos spatial data modeling using entity framework. It then hosts a range of web application routes utilized by a React application.


## Data Store


SQLite for now. 

I'll develop environment configurations to easily switch between SQLite and a true My/MSSQL backend eventually. /shrug


## Application Layer


.NET Core 6 + Entity Framework.

Unit testing via xUnit.


## Presentation Layer


React + Typescript + React Simple Maps

Maybe more to come.


## Thank you.
