As with anything public & made by me on this GITHUB -- please feel free to utilize as you wish as long as you follow the license agreements of any dependencies used.

I don't need any attribution directly. The only thing I ask is that you take steps and efforts to help budding software developers in the world whenever you can in the form of mentoring and tutoring.

Many of us are direct descendents of actions such as those and it is important that we take efforts to pass that on as we build a more unified world.

## Description

\
This software utilizes Spatialite extended SQLite as a data store, .NET Core 7 as an application layer, and React.js utilizing Typescript as a front-end. This software demos spatial data modeling using entity framework. It then hosts a range of web application routes utilized by a React application enabling CRUD operations against geographic data & artifacts serverside.
